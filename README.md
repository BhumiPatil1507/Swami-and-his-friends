CHAPTER I 

Monday Morning 

It was Monday morning. Swaminathan was reluctant to open his eyes. He 
considered Monday specially unpleasant in the calendar. After the delicious 
freedom of Saturday and Sunday, it was difficult to get into the Monday mood of 
work and discipline. He shuddered at the very thought of school: that dismal yellow 
building; the fire-eyed Vedanayagam, his class-teacher; and the Head Master with 
his thin long cane.... 
By eight he was at his desk in his 'room', which was only a corner in his 
father's dressing-room. He had a table on which all his things, his coat, cap, slate, 
ink-bottle, and books, were thrown in a confused heap. He sat on his stool and shut 
his eyes to recollect what work he had for the day: first of course there was 
Arithmetic--those five puzzles in Profit and Loss; then there was English--he had to 
copy down a page from his Eighth Lesson, and write dictionary meanings of difficult 
words; and then there was Geography. 
And only two hours before him to do all this heap of work and get ready for 
the school! 
Fire-eyed Vedanayagam was presiding over the class with his back to the 
long window. Through its bars one saw a bit of the drill ground and a corner of the 
veranda of the Infant Standards. There were huge windows on the left showing 
vast open grounds bound at the other extreme by the railway embankment. 
To Swaminathan existence in the classroom was possible only because he 
could watch the toddlers of the Infant Standards falling over one another, and 
through the windows on the left see the 12.30 mail gliding over the embankment, 
booming and rattling while passing over the Sarayu Bridge. The first hour passed 
of quietly. The second they had Arithmetic. Vedanayagam went out and returned in 
a few minutes in the role of an Arithmetic teacher. He droned on monotonously. 
Swaminathan was terribly bored. His teacher's voice was beginning to get on his 
nerves. He felt sleepy. 
The teacher called for home exercises. Swaminathan left his seat, jumped 
on the platform, and placed his note-book on the table. While the teacher was 
scrutinizing the sums, Swaminathan was gazing on his face, which seemed so 
tame at close quarters. His criticism of the teacher's face was that his eyes were 
too near each other, that there was more hair on his chin than one saw from the 
bench, and that he was very very bad-looking. His reverie was disturbed. He felt a 
terrible pain in the soft flesh above his left elbow. The teacher was pinching him 
with one hand, and with the other, crossing out all the sums. He wrote 'Very Bad' at 
the bottom of the page, flung the note-book in Swaminathan's face, and drove him 
back to his seat. 
Next period they had History. The boys looked forward to it eagerly. It was 
taken by D. Pillai, who had earned a name in the school for kindness and good 
humour. He was reputed to have never frowned or sworn at the boys at any time. 
His method of teaching History conformed to no canon of education. He told the 
boys with a wealth of detail the private histories of Vasco da Gama, Clive, 
Hastings, and others. When he described the various fights in History, one heard 
the clash of arms and the groans of the slain. He was the despair of the Head 
Master whenever the latter stole along the corridor with noiseless steps on his 
rounds of inspection. 
The Scripture period was the last in the morning. It was not such a dull 
hour after all. There were moments in it that brought stirring pictures before one: 
the Red Sea cleaving and making way for the Israelites; the physical feats of 
Samson; Jesus rising from the grave; and so on. The only trouble was that the 
Scripture master, Mr Ebenezar, was a fanatic.
'Oh, wretched idiots!' the teacher said, clenching his fists, Why do you 
worship dirty, lifeless, wooden idols and stone images? Can they talk? No. Can 
they see? No. Can they bless you? No. Can they take you to Heaven? No. Why? 
Because they have no life. What did your Gods do when Mohammed of Gazni 
smashed them to pieces, trod upon them, and constructed out of them steps for his 
lavatory? If those idols and images had life, why did they not parry Mohammed's 
onslaughts?' 
He then turned to Christianity. 'Now see our Lord Jesus. He could cure the 
sick, relieve the poor, and take us to Heaven. He was a real God. Trust him and he 
will take you to Heaven; the kingdom of Heaven is within us.' Tears rolled down 
Ebenezar's cheeks when he pictured Jesus before him. Next moment his face 
became purple with rage as he thought of Sri Krishna: "Did our Jesus go gadding 
about with dancing girls like your Krishna? Did our Jesus go about stealing butter 
like that archscoundrel Krishna'? Did our Jesus practice dark tricks on those 
around him?' 
He paused for breath. The teacher was intolerable to-day. Swaminathan's 
blood boiled. He got up and asked, 'If he did not, why was he crucified?' The 
teacher told him that he might come to him at the end of the period and learn it in 
private. Emboldened by this mild reply, Swaminathan put to him another question, 
'If he was a God, why did he eat flesh and fish and drink wine?' As a brahmin boy it 
was inconceivable to him that a God should be a non-vegetarian. In answer to this, 
Ebenezar left his seat, advanced slowly towards Swaminathan, and tried to wrench 
his left ear off. 
Next day Swaminathan was at school early. There was still half an hour 
before the bell. He usually spent such an interval in running round the school or in 
playing the Digging Game under the huge Tamarind tree. But to-day he sat apart, 
sunk in thought. He had a thick letter in his pocket. He felt guilty when he touched 
its edge with his fingers. He called himself an utter idiot for having told his father 
about Ebenezar the night before during the meal. 
As soon as the bell rang, he walked into the Head Master's room and 
handed him a letter. The Head Master's face became serious when he read:  
Sir,  
'I beg to inform you that my son Swaminathan of the First Form, A section, 
was assaulted by his Scripture Master yesterday in a fanatical rage. I hear that he 
is always most insulting and provoking in his references to the Hindu religion. It is 
bound to have a bad effect upon the boys. This is not the place for me to dwell 
upon the necessity for toleration in these matters. 
I am also informed that when my son got up to have a few doubts cleared, 
he was roughly handled by the same teacher. His ears were still red when he came 
home last evening. 
The one conclusion that I can come to is that you do not want non
Christian boys in your school. If it is so, you may kindly inform us as we are quite 
willing to withdraw our boys and send them elsewhere. I may remind you that 
Albert Mission School is not the only school that this town, Malgudi, possesses. I 
hope you will be kind enough to inquire into the matter and favour me with a reply. 
If not, I regret to inform you, I shall be constrained to draw the attention of higher 
authorities to these Unchristian practices. 
I have the honour to be, 
Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 
W. T. Sreenivasan.' 
When Swaminathan came out of the room, the whole school crowded 
round him and hung on his lips. But he treated inquisitive questions with haughty 
indifference. He honoured only four persons with his confidence. Those were the 
four that he liked and admired most in his class. The first was Somu, the Monitor, 
who carried himself with such an easy air. He set about his business, whatever it 
was, with absolute confidence and calmness. He was known to be chummy even 
with the teachers. No teacher ever put to him a question in the class. It could not 
be said that he shone brilliantly as a student. It was believed that only the Head 
Master could reprimand him. He was more or less the uncle of the class. 
Then there was Mani, the mighty Good-For-Nothing. He towered above all 
the other boys of the class. He seldom brought any books to the class, and never 
bothered about home-work. He came to the class, monopolised the last bench, and 
slept bravely. No teacher ever tried to prod him. 
It was said that a new teacher who once tried it very nearly lost his life. 
Mani bullied all strangers that came his way, be they big or small. People usually 
slunk aside when he passed. Wearing his cap at an angle, with a Tamil novel 
under his arm, he had been coming to the school ever since the old school peon 
could remember. In most of the classes he stayed longer than his friends did. 
Swaminathan was proud of his friendship. While others crouched in awe, he -could 
address him as 'Mani' with gusto and pat him on the back familiarly. Swaminathan 
admiringly asked whence Mani derived his power. Mani replied that he had a pair 
of wooden clubs at home with which he would break the backs of those that dared 
to tamper with him. 
Then there was Sankar, the most brilliant boy of the class. He solved any 
problem that was given to him in five minutes, and always managed to border on 
90 %. There was a belief among a section of the boys that if only he started cross
examining the teachers the teachers would be nowhere. Another section asserted 
that Sankar was a dud and that he learnt all the problems and their solution in 
advance by his sycophancy. He was said to receive his 90% as a result of washing 
clothes for his masters. He could speak to the teachers in English in the open 
class. He knew all the rivers, mountains, and countries in the world. He could 
repeat History in his sleep. Grammar was child's play to him. His face was radiant 
with intelligence, though his nose was almost always damp, and though he came to 
the class with his hair braided and with flowers in it. Swaminathan looked on him as 
a marvel. He was very happy when he made Mani see eye to eye with him and 
admit Sankar to their company. Mani liked him in his own way and brought down 
his heavy fist on Sankar's back whenever he felt inclined to demonstrate his 
affection. He would scratch his head and ask where the blithering fool of a scraggy 
youngster got all that brain from and why he should not part with a little of it. 
The fourth friend was Samuel known as the 'Pea' on account of his size. 
There was nothing outstanding about him. He was just ordinary, no outstanding 
virtue of muscle or intellect. He was as bad in Arithmetic as Swaminathan was. He 
was as apprehensive, weak, and nervous, about things as Swaminathan was. The 
bond between them was laughter. They were able to see together the same 
absurdities and incongruities in things. The most trivial and unnoticeable thing to 
others would tickle them to death. 
When Swaminathan told them what action his father had taken in the 
Scripture Master affair, there was a murmur of approval. Somu was the first to 
express it, by bestowing on his admirer a broad grin. Sankar looked serious and 
said, 'Whatever others might say, you did right in setting your father to the job.' The 
mighty Mani half closed his eyes and grunted an approval of sorts. He was only 
sorry that the matter should have been handled by elders. He saw no sense in it. 
Things of this kind should not be allowed to go beyond the four walls of the 
classroom. If he were Swaminathan, he would have closed the whole incident at 
the beginning by hurling an ink bottle, if nothing bigger was available, at the 
teacher. Well, there was no harm in what Swaminathan had done; he would have 
done infinitely worse by keeping quiet. 
However, let the Scripture Master look out: Mani had decided to wring his 
neck and break his back. Samuel the Pea, found himself in an acutely 
embarrassing position. On the one hand, he felt constrained to utter some remark. 
On the other, he was a Christian and saw nothing wrong in Ebenezar's 
observations, which seemed to be only an amplification of one of the 
Commandments. He felt that his right place was on Ebenezar's side. He managed 
to escape by making scathing comments on Ebenezar's dress and appearance and 
leaving it at that. 
The class had got wind of the affair. When the Scripture period arrived 
there was a general expectation of some dramatic denouement. But nothing 
happened. Ebenezar went on as merrily as ever. He had taken the trouble that day 
to plod through Baghavad Gita, and this generous piece of writing lends itself to 
any interpretation. In Ebenezar's hand it served as a weapon against Hinduism. 
His tone was as vigorous as ever, but in his denunciation there was more 
scholarship. He pulled Baghavad Gita to pieces, after raising Hinduism on its base. 
Step by step he was reaching the sublime heights of rhetoric. The class Bible lay 
uncared for on the table. 
The Head Master glided in. Ebenezar halted, pushing back his chair, and 
rose, greatly Hurried. He looked questioningly at the Head Master. The Head 
Master grimly asked him to go on. Ebenezar had meanwhile stealthily inserted a 
finger into the pages of the closed Bible. On the word of command from the Head 
Master, he tried to look sweet and relaxed his brow, which was knit in fury. He then 
opened his book where the finger marked and began to read at random. It 
happened to be the Nativity of Christ. The great event had occurred. There the 
divine occupant was in the manger. The Wise Men of the East were faithfully 
following the Star. 
The boys attended in their usual abstracted way. It made little difference to 
them whether Ebenezar was making a study of Hinduism in the light of Baghavad 
Gita or was merely describing the Nativity of Christ. 
The Head Master listened for a while and, in an undertone, demanded an 
explanation. They were nearing the terminal examination and Ebenezar had still 
not gone beyond the Nativity. When would he reach the Crucifixion and 
Resurrection, and begin to revise? Ebenezar was flabbergasted. He could not think 
of anything to say. He made a bare escape by hinting that that particular day of the 
week, he usually devoted to a rambling revision. Oh, no! He was not as far behind 
as that. He was in the proximity of the Last Supper. At the end of the day 
Swaminathan was summoned to the Head Master's room. As soon as he received 
the note, he had an impulse to run home. And when he expressed it, Mani took him 
in his hands, propelled him through to the Head Master's room, and gave him a 
gentle push in. Swaminathan staggered before the Head Master. 
Ebenezar was sitting on a stool, looking sheepish. The Head Master 
asked: 'What is the trouble, Swaminathan?' 
Oh--nothing, sir,' Swaminathan replied. 
'If it is nothing, why this letter?' 
'Oh!' Swaminathan ejaculated uncertainly. 
Ebenezar attempted to smile. Swaminathan wished to be well out of the 
whole affair. He felt he would not mind if a hundred Ebenezars said a thousand 
times worse things about the Gods. 
You know why I am here?' asked the Head Master. 
Swaminathan searched for an answer: the Head Master might be there to 
receive letters from boys' parents; he might be there to flay Ebenezars alive; he 
might be there to deliver six cuts with his cane every Monday at twelve o'clock. And 
above all why this question? 
'I don't know, sir,' Swaminathan replied innocently. 
'I am here to look after you,' said the Head Master. 
Swaminathan was relieved to find that the question had such a simple 
answer. 
'And so continued the Head Master, 'you must come to me if you want any 
help, before you go to your father.' 
Swaminathan furtively glanced at Ebenezar, who writhed in his chair. 
'I am sorry,' said the Head Master, 'that you should have been so foolish as 
to go to your father about this simple matter. I shall look into it. Take this letter to 
your father. 
Swaminathan took the letter and shot out of the room with great relief.
